## About Me

I am a postdoc associate at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)).
Before joining Northeastern, I got Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Advisor: Prof. [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler)). 
My interdisciplinary background in Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) and Human-Computer Interaction (**HCI**) focuses on **Use-Inspired AI**, where I aim to design human-centered AI systems to support stakeholders' workflow in medical, healthcare, and education scenarios, empowering **human-AI collaboration**. 
<!-- enables me to design use-inspired AI systems that responsibly support real-world stakeholders' collaboration, empowering **human-AI collaboration**.  -->
In particular, I propose human-centered NLP, a framework comprising three critical pillars: (i) uncovering real-world stakeholders’  workflow, (ii) developing domain-specific NLP models in low-resource environments, and (iii) embedding human-centered systems into stakeholders’ workflow. 


## Research

<!-- I believe it is critical to look into the fundamentals of **human-human collaboration**, as nearly all human work today are collaborative effort, and thus, we should design AI to better work together with humans.
To achieve this objective, a comprehensive understanding of stakeholders' current workflow, needs and challenges forms the foundation of **Human-AI collaboration**. 
From there, we need to design AI algorithms and systems -- particularly with NLP technologies -- that integrate seamlessly into stakeholders' workflow, namely **Human-Centered NLP systems**.  -->

<!-- 
My prior and current work span across medical, healthcare and children education scenarios. -->


#### I. Uncovering Real-World Stakeholders’ Needs and Challenges

<!-- The first line of my research is to identify needs and challenges in stakeholders’ workflow with qualitative research methods and involvement of stakeholders. -->

## Note

<span style="color:#60a561">My apologies for the inconvenience that the publication list and CV on my website are usually not up-to-date -- I'm trying, but honestly this is more time consuming than writing grant proposals. Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hJlsDfAAAAAJ) for latest update. </span>


The best way to reach out is through emails <span style="color:#3282b8">b [dot] yao [at] northeastern [dot] edu</span>. 
<!-- With that being said, my apologies for not being able to reply all the emails in a timely manner.  -->



<!-- It is my honor to assist and mentor students throughout their research journey. I am willing to dedicate a 30-min meeting every week to each research assistant who work with me -- you can find me through email and slack. -->
