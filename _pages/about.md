I am a Postdoc researcher at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)).
My research lies at the intersection of **NLP** and **HCI**. 
Before joining Prof. Dakuo's group, I got Ph.D. from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Advisor: Prof. [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler)). 
My dissertation focuses on *enhancing machine reasoning via Active Learning (AL) with human rationales* -- I propose a novel AL architecture with a diversity-based sampling strategy that generates and benefits from natural language explanations for data sampling and prediction ([AL Architecture](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@EMNLP23</span>, [Human Rationale Evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.821/)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@ACL23</span>)


<!-- <span style="color:#9747FF"></span> -->
I strive to **enhance human-AI collaborative workflow with NLP system in real-world, domain-specific scenarios**. To list a few:
- Medical & Clinical 
  - [Sepsis Early Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12368)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@CHI24</span>
  - [Mental-LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14385)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@IMWUT24</span>
  - Patient-Provider Communication ([Remote Patient Monitoring for Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09357)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@IMWUT24</span>, Post-Treatment Cancer Patient)


- Children Education 
  - [FairytaleQA Dataset](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.34/)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@ACL22</span>
  - [Children QA Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.54/)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@ACL22</span>
  - [StoryBuddy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517479)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@CHI22<span>
  - [KG-Based RAG for QA Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09756)
  - [Parent's Need for Children Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13804))


My research interests also extend to **exploring efficient development and utilization of NLP models**, including
- [In-Context Sampling for LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09782)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@NAACL24</span>
- [LLM vs. Domain-Specific Compact LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09825)

I have served on program committees for various top conferences and journals: \
<span style="color:#EB7F00">EMNLP 23</span>, 
<span style="color:#EB7F00">NAACL 24</span>, 
<span style="color:#EB7F00">ACL ARR (from Aug23)</span>, 
<span style="color:#EB7F00">CHI 24</span>, 
<span style="color:#EB7F00">IUI 24</span>, 
<span style="color:#EB7F00">IMWUT 24</span>, 
<span style="color:#EB7F00">IJHCS</span>






<!-- In addition, I am devoted to <span style="color:#EB7F00">build LLM-Simulated human agents</span> for different populations and domains.  -->
