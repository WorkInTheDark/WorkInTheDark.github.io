I am an **associate research scientist** in the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)). I received my PhD from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Prof. [Jim Hendler](https://www.cs.rpi.edu/~hendler/). 

### Research

My research lies at the intersection of *Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)* and *Natural Language Processing (NLP)*, with two primary interests: 

##### **I. Design, Develop, and Evaluate Human-Centered NLP Systems**

Particularly in medical and healthcare, we engage multi-stakeholders to design and validate AI/LLM-driven multi-modal intelligent systems for **remote patient monitoring (RPM)**, **patient-provider communication**, and **clinical decision-makings**. Selected work include: 

Sepsis Diagnosis \[[CHI '24](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642343)\] \
Asynchronous Older Adults-Provider Communication \[[Talk2Care (IMWUT '24)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3659625)\] \
RPM for Post-Operative Cancer Patients \[[RECOVER](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05740), [CardioAI (CHI '25)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3706598.3714272)\] 






##### **II. Design LLM/AI Agents To Effectively Establish Mutual Human-Agent Collaboration**

I envision a near future where AI agents, as they learn to think and act like humans, will work **with** us, not for us, becoming functionally indistinguishable from any other remote human collaborator.
The research roadmap in this direction is bifolds: 1) design and evaluate AI agents to **think and behave collaboratively**; 2) design interface and interaction patterns to **establish mutual human-agent collaboration** through the lens of remote collaboration with decades of knowledge about what makes remote teams trust each other, share context, and coordinate effectively. Selected work include:

Rationale Alignment Between Models and Humans via Active Learning \[[EMNLP '23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/)\] \
Dynamic Persona Refinement Framework \[[In Submission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14205)\] \
Configurable Research Platform for Human-Agent Collaboration \[[InSubmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18008)\]
