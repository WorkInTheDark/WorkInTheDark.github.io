<span style="color:#395f95">I am seeking self-motivated research assistants who are interested in working with me on Human-Centered NLP research projects -- I'm working on a Google form for applicants </span>

<span style="color:#88aecc">It is my honor to assist and mentor students throughout their research journey. I am willing to dedicate a 30-min Zoom meeting every week to each research assistant who work with me -- you can find me through email and slack.</span>

## About Me

I am a postdoc associate at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)).
Before joining Prof. Wang's group, I got Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Advisor: Prof. [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler)). My research training has immersed me in the interdisciplinary fields of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, aiming to foster responsible and effective *human-AI collaboration* with *human-centered NLP system* in specialized real-world scenaios.


## Research


Currently, I am engaged in the interdisciplinary research of blending NLP technologies with human-centered systems to enhancing human-AI collaborative workflow in real-world, domain-specific scenarios. My prior and ongoing work focus on three areas:




#### i. Medical and Clinical Scenarios
I focus on identifying stakeholders' practical needs and challenges, as well as designing human-centered system, powered by domain-adaptive AI/LLM, to facilitate human-AI collaboration through different applications, such as Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), patient-provider communication, clinical decision-making, etc.

#### ii. Story-Based Children Education
I focus on designing conversational interfaces for story-based children education. In addition, I develop domain-specific NLP technologies to support different user needs and educational specifications.

#### iii. Efficient Domain-Specific Model Development in Low-Resource Scenarios
Spanned from my doctoral dissertation, I am interested in developing low-resource learning techniques for domain-adaptive NLP technologies, which include fine-tuning compact models and prompting LLMs, in real-world scenarios, where expert resources and high-quality data annotations are hard to access.

## Note

My apologies for the inconvenience that the publication list and CV on my website are usually not up-to-date -- I'm trying, but honestly this is more time consuming than writing grant proposals. Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hJlsDfAAAAAJ) for latest update. 


Besides, the best way for reaching out is through emails <span style="color:#5f8cc8">b dot yao at northeastern dot edu</span>. With that being said, my apologies for not being able to reply all the emails. 

<!-- , I am continue to design and develop language model systems for real-world applications, adhering to human-centered design principles. These systems will address challenges and needs in real-world scenarios for various stakeholders, with a special focus on creating human-centered AI solutions that support clinical decision-making, older adult healthcare, children's education, and ethical technology use. -->
<!-- My long-term research goals include becoming an independent researcher and developing domain-specialized and personalized human-centered AI systems to facilitate human decision-making and workflow in real-world scenarios through more nuanced and helpful interactions.
