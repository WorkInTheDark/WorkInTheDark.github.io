I am a postdoc associate at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)).
My research at the intersection of NLP and HCI focuses on the responsible design of **Human-Centered NLP** systems to support **stakeholders' collaboration** in domain-specific scenarios, including medical, healthcare, and education. 
Recently, my research interest extends to **personalization** of NLP models and systems, such as [LLM Role-Playing Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13012).
<!-- My research at the intersection of NLP and HCI focuses on **Use-Inspired AI**, where I strive to responsibly design human-centered NLP systems to support **stakeholders' collaboration** in real-world scenarios.  -->

<!-- I propose a **human-centered NLP** framework that comprises three critical pillars: 1) uncovering stakeholders' workflow, 2) adapting NLP technologies to specific domains with low-resource learning, and 3) designing human-centered systems to be integrated into stakeholders' workflow. -->

## Research

In **medical** and **healthcare**, my research focuses on understanding the needs and challenges encountered by care providers, caregivers, and patients in different clinical scenarios, followed by the human-centered design of AI-assisted Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) systems.
Prior work include: early diagnosis of sepsis [\[CHI '24\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642343); RPM for older adults [\[IMWUT '24a\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3659625), post-surgery care of GI cancer patients [\[1\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13409) [\[2\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05740), cardiotoxicity of cancer patients [\[3\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03586) [\[CHI '25a\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04592), and mental health of youth concussion patients [\[4\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03732).


<!-- In **medical** and **healthcare** scenarios, my research focuses on AI-assisted Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM).  -->
<!-- For CDSS, we looked into the human-AI competition actuality for sepsis diagnosis [\[CHI '23\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642343).  -->
<!-- For RPM, we invesigated the clinical specifications for post-operative GI cancer patients [\[In Submission\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13409), cancer patients' cardiotoxicity [\[In Submission\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03586), and older adults with chronical diseases. -->
<!-- Subsequently, we engage stakeholders in the design process of human-centered NLP systems to integrate the systems into their workflow to address needs and challenges, such as RECOVER [\[In Submission\]]() for GI cancer patients, CardioAI [\[In Submission\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04592) for breast cancer patients, and Talk2Care [\[IMWUT '24a\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3659625) for older adults. -->

My research extends to support parents' need in interactive storytelling for **children education**, including needs solicitations [\[CSCW '24\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3687035); experts-annotated datasets, such as FairytaleQA [\[ACL '22a\]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.34/) and StorySparkQA [\[EMNLP '24\]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.961/);
QA-pair generation pipelines [\[ACL '22b\]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.54/); 
and human-centered interactive storytelling systems [\[CHI '22\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517479) [\[CHI '25b\]]().

<!-- in which we invesigate parents' needs in interactive storytelling [\[CSCW '24\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3687035), and work with education experts to collect high-quality educational datasets, such as FairytaleQA [\[ACL '22a\]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.34/) and StorySparkQA [\[EMNLP '24\]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.961/).
These datasets support the subsequent development of domain-specific NLP models for QA-pair generation [\[ACL '22b\]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.54/) as well as the human-centered design of interactive storytelling systems, for example, StoryBuddy [\[CHI '22\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517479). -->


Following my doctoral thesis, I am also devoted to develop **efficient domain-adaptation** and **personalization** methodologies for NLP models, which include: Active Learning for compact models [\[EMNLP '23\]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/); 
In-Context Sampling [\[NAACL '24\]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-naacl.115/) and 
Knowledge Graph-RAG [\[CHI '25b\]]() for LLMs; 
Supervised fine-tuning for domain-specific LLMs, such as Mental-LLM [\[IMWUT '24b\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3643540);
and LLM Role-Playing Agents [\[5\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13012).


<!-- Another line of my research centers on bridging the divergence between the standardized & static model development and the dynamic & complex real-world scenarios via innovative **low-resource domain adaptation** techniques. I proposed novel Active Learning framework [\[EMNLP '23\]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/) for fine-tuning task-specific models, In-Context Sampling prompting strategy for robust ICL with LLMs [\[NAACL '24\]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-naacl.115/), and instructional finetune LLMs for mental health prediction (Mental-LLM [\[IMWUT '24b\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3643540)) -->
