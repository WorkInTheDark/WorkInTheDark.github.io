I am a postdoc associate at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)).
My interdisciplinary research at the intersection of NLP and HCI focuses on **Use-Inspired AI**, where I strive to responsibly design human-centered AI systems with advanced NLP technologies to support **stakeholders' collaboration** in real-world scenarios. 

<!-- I propose a **human-centered NLP** framework that comprises three critical pillars: 1) uncovering stakeholders' workflow, 2) adapting NLP technologies to specific domains with low-resource learning, and 3) designing human-centered systems to be integrated into stakeholders' workflow. -->

## Research

In **medical** and **healthcare** scenarios, my research focuses on AI-assisted Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) and Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). 
For CDSS, we looked into the human-AI competition actuality for sepsis diagnosis [\[CHI '23\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3613904.3642343). 
For RPM, we invesigated the clinical specifications for post-operative GI cancer patients [\[In Submission\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13409), cancer patients' cardiotoxicity [\[In Submission\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03586), and older adults with chronical diseases.
Subsequently, we engage stakeholders in the design process of human-centered NLP systems to integrate the systems into their workflow to address needs and challenges, such as RECOVER [\[In Submission\]]() for GI cancer patients, CardioAI [\[In Submission\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04592) for breast cancer patients, and Talk2Care [\[IMWUT '24a\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3659625) for older adults.

My research extends to **children education** scenario, in which we invesigate parents' needs in interactive storytelling [\[CSCW '24\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3687035), and work with education experts to collect high-quality educational datasets, such as FairytaleQA [\[ACL '22a\]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.34/) and StorySparkQA [\[EMNLP '24\]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.emnlp-main.961/).
These datasets support the subsequent development of domain-specific NLP models for QA-pair generation [\[ACL '22b\]](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.54/) as well as the human-centered design of interactive storytelling systems, for example, StoryBuddy [\[CHI '22\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517479).

Another line of my research centers on bridging the divergence between the standardized & static model development and the dynamic & complex real-world scenarios via innovative **low-resource domain adaptation** techniques. I proposed novel Active Learning framework [\[EMNLP '23\]](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/) for fine-tuning task-specific models, In-Context Sampling prompting strategy for robust ICL with LLMs [\[NAACL '24\]](https://aclanthology.org/2024.findings-naacl.115/), and instructional finetune LLMs for mental health prediction (Mental-LLM [\[IMWUT '24b\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3643540))

<!-- ## Research -->

<!-- I believe it is critical to look into the fundamentals of **human-human collaboration**, as nearly all human work today are collaborative effort, and thus, we should design AI to better work together with humans.
To achieve this objective, a comprehensive understanding of stakeholders' current workflow, needs and challenges forms the foundation of **Human-AI collaboration**. 
From there, we need to design AI algorithms and systems -- particularly with NLP technologies -- that integrate seamlessly into stakeholders' workflow, namely **Human-Centered NLP systems**.  -->

The best way to reach out is through emails: <span style="color:#3282b8">b [dot] yao [at] northeastern [dot] edu</span>. 
<!-- With that being said, my apologies for not being able to reply all the emails in a timely manner.  -->



<!-- It is my honor to assist and mentor students throughout their research journey. I am willing to dedicate a 30-min meeting every week to each research assistant who work with me -- you can find me through email and slack. -->
