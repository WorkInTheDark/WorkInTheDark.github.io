<!-- <span style="color:#c2613e">I am seeking self-motivated research assistants who are interested in working with me on Human-Centered NLP research projects -- I'm working on a Google Form for applicants </span> -->

<span style="color:#a70000"> - I am on the job market this year looking for tenured-track assistant professor position. </span> \
<span style="color:#c2613e"> - Northeastern Human-Centered AI Lab is seeking self-motivated research assistants who are interested in working with us. Please reach out to Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/) directly. </span>



## About Me

I am a postdoc associate at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)).
Before joining Northeastern, I got Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Advisor: Prof. [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler)). My research training has immersed me in the interdisciplinary fields of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, where I aim to promote responsible and effective Human-AI Collaboration with human-centered NLP system in real-world, domain-specific scenaios. 


## Research

<!-- I believe it is critical to look into the fundamentals of **human-human collaboration**, as nearly all human work today are collaborative effort, and thus, we should design AI to better work together with humans.
To achieve this objective, a comprehensive understanding of stakeholders' current workflow, needs and challenges forms the foundation of **Human-AI collaboration**. 
From there, we need to design AI algorithms and systems -- particularly with NLP technologies -- that integrate seamlessly into stakeholders' workflow, namely **Human-Centered NLP systems**.  -->


My prior and current work span across medical, healthcare and children education scenarios.

## Note

<span style="color:#c2613e">My apologies for the inconvenience that the publication list and CV on my website are usually not up-to-date -- I'm trying, but honestly this is more time consuming than writing grant proposals. Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hJlsDfAAAAAJ) for latest update. </span>


The best way to reach out is through emails <span style="color:#6c7663">b [dot] yao [at] northeastern [dot] edu</span>. 
<!-- With that being said, my apologies for not being able to reply all the emails in a timely manner.  -->



<!-- It is my honor to assist and mentor students throughout their research journey. I am willing to dedicate a 30-min meeting every week to each research assistant who work with me -- you can find me through email and slack. -->
