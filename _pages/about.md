My research interests lie at the intersection of **NLP** and **HCI**. My dissertation primarily focuses on enhancing language model reasoning via Active Learning (AL) with human rationales -- I proposed a novel AL architecture with a diversity-based AL sampling strategy that faithfully utilizes and generates natural language explanations, check it out from my [AL Architecture@EMNLP23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/) and [Humana Rationale Evaluation@ACL22](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.821/) papers!

More recently, I focus on 
how to <span style="color:#9747FF">enhance human-AI collaborative workflow</span> with language models in different real-world scenarios, such as clinical diagnosis ([Sepsis Diagnosis@CHI24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12368), [MentalLLM@IMWUT24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14385)), patient-provider communication ([Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09357))
, children education ([FairytaleQA Dataset@ACL22](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.34/), [Children QA Generation@ACL22](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.54/), [StoryBuddyCHI22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517479), [KG-Based RAG for QA Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09756), [Parent's Need for Children Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13804)), etc.

In the meantime, I continue my research in NLP by exploring <span style="color:#9747FF">efficient strategies for fine-tuning and inference with LLMs and domain-specific compact models</span> (i.e., [In-Context Sampling Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09782), [LLM vs. Domain-Specific Compact LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09825)).

I am a Postdoc researcher at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)). 
My research lies at the intersection of **NLP** and **HCI**. 
Before joining Prof. Dakuo's group, I got Ph.D. from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, advised by Prof. [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler). 
My dissertation focuses on *enhancing machine reasoning via Active Learning (AL) with human rationales* -- I propose a novel AL architecture with a diversity-based AL sampling strategy that faithfully utilizes and generates natural language explanations ([AL Architecture@EMNLP23](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/), [Human Rationale Evaluation@ACL22](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.821/))



In terms of my research direction, I strive to <span style="color:#9747FF">enhance human-AI collaborative workflow with NLP models in real-world scenarios</span>, such as
- Clinical Diagnosis ([Sepsis Diagnosis@CHI24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12368), [Mental-LLM@IMWUT24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14385))
- Children Education ([FairytaleQA Dataset@ACL22](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.34/), [Children QA Generation@ACL22](https://aclanthology.org/2022.acl-long.54/), [StoryBuddyCHI22](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3491102.3517479), [KG-Based RAG for QA Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09756), [Parent's Need for Children Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13804))
- Patient-Provider Communication ([Older Adults](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09357))

with a specific focus to <span style="color:#9747FF">explore efficient development and utilization of LLMs and domain-specific compact models</span>, including
- [In-Context Sampling Strategy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09782)
- [LLM vs. Domain-Specific Compact LM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09825)

I have served on program committees for various top conferences and journals, including ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, CHI, and IMWUT. 





<!-- In addition, I am devoted to <span style="color:#9747FF">build LLM-Simulated human agents</span> for different populations and domains.  -->

<!-- <i><span style="color:#999999">People often ask me why I don't have a profile photo. The truth is that I haven't been in front of a camera in almost a decade, except for renewing my driver's license and passport. 
So, despite my fellows "strongly recommending" me having a profile photo, I don't really have a picture to put here (and other social networking platforms) yet. This challenging task is on my radar, though.  </span></i> -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
