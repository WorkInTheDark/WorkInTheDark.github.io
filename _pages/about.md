5th year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science (Advisor: [Prof. Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler)) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI).

His research interests lie at the intersection of <span style="color:#edc707">NLP</span> and <span style="color:#edc707">HCI</span>, currently focusing on <span style="color:#edc707">enhancing human-AI collaborative workflow in various real-world scenarios</span>. He had worked closely with researchers from IBM Research and Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/) from Northeastern University.

<!-- <i><span style="color:#999999">People often ask me why I don't have a profile photo. The truth is that I haven't been in front of a camera in almost a decade, except for renewing my driver's license and passport. 
So, despite my fellows "strongly recommending" me having a profile photo, I don't really have a picture to put here (and other social networking platforms) yet. This challenging task is on my radar, though.  </span></i> -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
