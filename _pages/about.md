I am a postdoc associate at Northeastern University (PI: Prof. [Dakuo Wang](https://www.dakuowang.com/)).
<!-- My research lies at the intersection of **NLP** and **HCI**.  -->
Before joining Prof. Wang's group, I got Ph.D. in Computer Science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (Advisor: Prof. [Jim Hendler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Hendler)). My research training has immersed me in the interdisciplinary fields of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, aiming to enhance machine reasoning and human-computer synergies. 


### Research

My doctoral dissertation addresses enhancing data annotation efficiency, improving model performance, and reducing training effort for fine-tuning language models in low-resource and specialized real-world domains, where high quality data annotations are scarce.

<!-- I propose a novel Active Learning (AL) architecture with an AL data sampling strategy that benefits from human-annotated and model-generated natural language explanations for data sampling and prediction ([AL Architecture](https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.778/)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@EMNLP23</span>, [Human Rationale Evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.821/)<span style="color:#EB7F00">@ACL23</span>). -->

<!-- I propose a novel dual-model Active Learning framework for fine-tuning domain-specific compact models with multi-modal human annotations and an innovative In-Context Sampling strategy to achieve robust domain-specific task performance without fine-tuning generic large language models. My research interests also encompass the design and development of language model-based systems for real-world applications. For example, I have worked on interactive storytelling systems to support parents in teaching children reading comprehension skills, imparting real-world knowledge beyond story content, and providing STEM education. -->

### Note

My apologies for the inconvenience that the publication list and CV on my website are usually not the up-to-date version -- I'm trying, but it is quite time consuming. Please refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hJlsDfAAAAAJ) page for latest update. 


Besides, the best way for reaching out is through emails (b dot yao at northeastern dot edu). With that being said, my apologies for not being able to reply all the emails due to the large amount of emails I receive everyday and my limited bandwidth to keep track of all of them. 

<!-- , I am continue to design and develop language model systems for real-world applications, adhering to human-centered design principles. These systems will address challenges and needs in real-world scenarios for various stakeholders, with a special focus on creating human-centered AI solutions that support clinical decision-making, older adult healthcare, children's education, and ethical technology use. -->
<!-- My long-term research goals include becoming an independent researcher and developing domain-specialized and personalized human-centered AI systems to facilitate human decision-making and workflow in real-world scenarios through more nuanced and helpful interactions. Additionally, I am interested in investigating difficulties in human-human communication and collaboration and designing, developing, and evaluating language model-based assistant tools to improve human communication. -->
