## Brazilian Jiu-jitsu
I have been actively training Brazilian Jiu-jitsu with [Alan Condon](https://518empire.com/about-us/), a lifelong martial artist with black belts in 7 different martial art styles, since the pandemic began.

I consider myself fortunate to have developed this hobby that I am passionate about. The resilience I cultivated during the training has been invaluable in helping me navigate the challenges I have encountered throughout my doctoral studies.

If you ask me, **what is Brazilian Jiu-jitsu**? 
    
* The gentle art of folding clothes, while people are still wearing them.
* Involuntary yoga.

## Photography

I have a preference for vintage documentary photography genre and interesting bokeh. Fuji XT3 was my primary camera because Fuji's film texture and the lenses are relative small. Now I tend to use Leica Q2 -- and iPhone, of course.

In addition, I collect vintage M42 lenses. 
Those lenses sing unique beauty of their imperfection, such as the soviet **Tair 11A 135mm f2.8** (20 aperture blades is just an breathtaking art) and Helios-44 58mm f/2. I had a few mint Voigtlander lenses (Skoparex 35mm f/3.4, olor-Skoparex 35mm f/2.8, Tessar 50mm f/2.8, Color-Ultron 50mm f/1.8) at hand, which are all beauty beyond measure.

I admire the gems of wisdom in the development of human technology -- lenses, mechanical watches, everything.

## Travelling

Travelling is my all-time favorite thing to do. I just love learning about different cultures, trying new foods, and experiencing different ways of life around the world. And I'm a total aviation enthusiast, so I love checking out different airlines and airports, and trying out swanky hotels. 

Of course, with the pandemic, all my travel plans have been thrown out the window. But even though I can't travel right now, I still love thinking about all the amazing places I want to visit. And honestly, there's something about being in a new place that just helps me unwind and de-stress, almost like I'm doing meditation.

- **FUN FACT(S)**
    * I've been living in the northeastern United States for 10 years already, but the truth is that <span style="color:#EB7F00">Los Angeles</span> is where my heart is. Whenever I feel like taking a break, I don't even think twice about booking a flight to LA! \
    <span style="color:#EB7F00">PS - LA has the absolute best Korean food anywhere in the world!</span>

## Assembling and Collecting

I'm into putting together models, toys, and custom electronics in my spare time. It's just satisfying to see the final product after putting in all the work to assemble it. To list a few:
- Large Lego sets, e.g., Technic Series
- Gundam 
- Custom liquid cooling pc
- Custom keyboard


I also love hunting for cool stuff and adding it to my collection. To list a few: 
- Electronics and mechanics that show aesthetically pleasing designs 
- Diecast plane & car models
- Ties & cufflinks & rings
- Books!
