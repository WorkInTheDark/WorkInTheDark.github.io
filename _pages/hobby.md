## Brazilian Jiu-jitsu
I have been actively training Brazilian Jiu-jitsu with [Alan Condon](https://518empire.com/about-us/), a lifelong martial artist with black belts in 7 different martial art styles, for three years.

I consider myself fortunate to have developed this hobby that I am passionate about. The resilience I cultivated during the training has been invaluable in helping me navigate the challenges I have encountered throughout my doctoral studies.

If you ask me, **what is Brazilian Jiu-jitsu**? 
    
* The gentle art of folding clothes, while people are still wearing them.
* Involuntary yoga.

## Travelling

Travelling is my all-time favorite thing to do. I just love learning about different cultures, trying new foods, and experiencing different ways of life around the world. And I'm a total aviation enthusiast, so I love checking out different airlines and airports, and trying out swanky hotels. 

Of course, with the pandemic, all my travel plans have been thrown out the window. But even though I can't travel right now, I still love thinking about all the amazing places I want to visit. And honestly, there's something about being in a new place that just helps me unwind and de-stress, almost like I'm doing meditation.

- **FUN FACT(S)**
    * I've been living in the northeastern United States for almost 10 years now, but the truth is that **Los Angeles** is where my heart is. Whenever I feel like taking a break, I don't even think twice about booking a flight to LA! \
    *PS - They have the absolute best Korean food anywhere in the world!*

## Assembling and Collecting

I'm into putting together models, toys, and custom electronics in my spare time. It's just satisfying to see the final product after putting in all the work to assemble it. To list a few:
- Large Lego sets, e.g., Technic Series
- Custom liquid cooling pc
- Custom keyboard



I also love hunting for cool stuff and adding it to my collection. To list a few: 
- Electronics and mechanics that show aesthetically pleasing designs 
- Diecast plane & car models
- Ties & cufflinks & rings
- Books!
