        - title: <b><u>Objective Human Explanation Evaluation</u></b>
          # contents:
          contents:
            - Proposed a prompt-based unified data format for different tasks
            - Enhanced the established Simulatability score with <b><i>a novel metric to evaluate explanations' helpfulness at fine-tuning and inference</i></u>
            - Our metric can evaluate 5 datasets with 2 models (T5 and BART) consistently, while the established metric falls short
        - title: <b><u>Active Learning for Human Labels and Explanations</u></b>
          contents:
            - <b><i>Proposed a dual-model AL framework</i></b> to generate natural language explanations as additional information for the prediction model
            - Designed a novel AL selection strategy based on the similarity between unlabeled data and human-annotated explanations
            - Justified human explanations with our AL framework are beneficial for the prediction model to perform better and converge faster

        - title: <b><u>QA-Pair Generation (QAG) for Children Storybooks</u></b>
          contents:
            - Implemented a QAG system with 1). a <b><i>heuristics-based answer extraction</i></b> module, question; 2). a fine-tuned <b><i>BART-based question generation</i></b> module; 3). a <b><i>DistilBERT-based ranking module</i></b> to rank and select best QA-pairs
            - Outperformed 2 SOTA QAG systems on the FairytaleQA dataset in terms of the mean average ROUGE-L precision at top 1, 3, 5, and 10 QA-pairs generated per story section
            - Developed an <b><i>interactive story-telling web application</i></b> built upon our QAG system and justified its usefulness through a user study with 12 pairs of parents and children
        - title: <b><u>FairytaleQA Dataset for Children Education</u></b>
          contents:
            - Supervised education experts with carefully designed annotation schema to create <b><i>10, 580 QA-pairs on 278 fairytale stories</i></b>
            - <b><i>Benchmarked FairytaleQA dataset</i></b> can provide helpfulness on Question Answering and Question Generation tasks by fine-tuning various SOTA language models and performing in-depth analysis

      year: 2023
      description:
        - Curated high-quality human-annotated datasets for mental issue detection in online communities
        - Designed prompts for augmented tasks with curated datasets and <b><i>instruction-fine-tuned an Alpaca and FLAN-T5 model</i></b>
        - <b><i>Benchmarked with SOTA models</i></b> (e.g., fine-tuned Alpaca-Lora, mental-RoBERTa) and <b><i>conducted extensive ablation studies</i></b> on prompt selection, subsampling, and transfer learning
    - title: QA Annotation Framework with Extern KG Support
      year: 2023
      description:
        - The framework supports human annotators to select a preferred concept, then retrieve and rank the most relevant Commonsense Knowledge from ConceptNet to facilitate QA-pair annotation
        - Human evaluation justified that expert-created QA-pairs with our framework are preferred to the ones generated by carefully prompted GPT-3.5 few-shot approaches
